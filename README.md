#2DoBox / Get Done

###Description

Welcome to the codebase of our todo app. Our feature testing was done using [webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io/) and Selenium, unit tests were done using Mocha and Chai. The application is built with Javascript, jQuery, and Sass. Webpack is used to organize and compile our code.
